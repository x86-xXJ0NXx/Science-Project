  <h1>San Andreas Fault Earthquake</h1>
  <p>The Power Beneath California</p>


<main>

  <section>
    <h2>Event Overview</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> The Great San Francisco Earthquake</p>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 18, 1906</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Northern California, USA (Epicenter near San Francisco)</p>
      <p><strong>Fault Type:</strong> Trform Fault – San Andreas Fault</p>
      <p><strong>Tectonic Plates:</strong> Pacific Plate and North American Plate</p>
      <p><strong>Boundary Type:</strong> Transform Boundary (plates slide past each other)</p>
      <p><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Estimated Magnitude 7.9 Earthquake</p>
      <p><strong>Depth:</strong> Approx. 5 miles</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Geological Process</h2>
    <div class="content">
      The San Andreas Fault marks the boundary where the Pacific Plate moves northwest past the North American Plate. 
      Over time, stress builds up along this transform boundary. When the stress overcomes friction, the rocks suddenly slip, releasing energy as seismic waves.
      This process causes the ground to rupture, creating an earthquake.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
    <div class="content">
      On April 18, 1906, at 5:12 a.m., a massive earthquake struck San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area. 
      The shaking lasted about 45 seconds, followed by devastating fires that burned for several days. Nearly 80% of San Francisco was destroyed.
      The earthquake ruptured roughly 296 miles of the San Andreas Fault and was felt from southern Oregon to Los Angeles.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Frequency And History</h2>
    <div class="content">
      Large earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault occur roughly every 150 to 200 years. 
      Previous major ruptures are believed to have occurred around 1680 and 1812. 
      Scientists warn that another "Big One" could strike Southern California in the coming decades.

  <section>
    <h2>Scientific Information</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Fault Type:</strong> Transform Fault</p>
      <p><strong>Tectonic Plate Map:</strong> The San Andreas Fault divides the Pacific Plate (moving northwest) and the North American Plate (moving southeast).</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Damage Reports and Population Impact</h2>
    <div class="content">
      The 1906 earthquake caused catastrophic destruction:
      <ul>
        <li>Over <strong>28,000 buildings</strong> destroyed.</li>
        <li>Estimated <strong>3,000 fatalities</strong>.</li>
        <li>More than <strong>250,000 people</strong> left homeless out of a population of 410,000.</li>
        <li>Economic losses exceeded <strong>$400 million</strong> in 1906 (equivalent to over $11 billion today).</li>
      </ul>
      The population of San Francisco temporarily declined as residents fled the city, but recovery efforts over the next decade led to a rapid rebuild and population growth.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Short and Long-Term Effects</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Fires, loss of population, infrastructure collapse, food and water shortages, and mass displacement.</p>
        <p><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Redesign of city planning, major updates to building codes, improved seismic research, and creation of the U.S. Geological Survey's earthquake monitoring systems.</p>
      
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Nearby Resources & Settlement</h2>
    <div class="content">
      The San Francisco Bay Area developed near the fault because of its natural harbors, fertile land, and access to trade routes.
      After the earthquake, resource availability like water access, transportation, and construction materials determined how quickly neighborhoods were rebuilt.
      These resources also influenced the direction of new settlements away from unstable fault zones.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Climate Impact</h2>
    <div class="content">
      Unlike volcanic eruptions, earthquakes do not significantly affect global climate. 
      However, the fires following the 1906 quake temporarily increased local air pollution and smoke levels for several weeks.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Preparedness and Warnings</h2>
    <div class="content">
      In 1906, there were <strong>no early warning systems</strong> or seismic monitoring tools. 
      So people were completely unprepared, and no alerts were issued prior to the event.
      Today, California has advanced systems such as <strong>ShakeAlert</strong>, which can send notifications seconds before shaking begins.
      Communities regularly conduct earthquake drills and enforce strict seismic building codes.
      Early warning systems and education programs have drastically improved human preparedness since 1906.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Human Adaptation</h2>
    <div class="content">
      In response to the 1906 disaster, humans adapted by:
      <ul>
        <li>Developing earthquake-resistant architecture and engineering.</li>
        <li>Enforcing seismic building standards statewide.</li>
        <li>Installing motion sensors, GPS fault monitoring, and emergency alert systems.</li>
        <li>Creating the U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program.</li>
        <li>Educating the public through events like the <strong>Great California ShakeOut</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      These actions have made California one of the most earthquake-prepared regions in the world.

    <h2>News and Modern Insights</h2>
    <div class="content">
      Modern scientists continue to monitor the San Andreas Fault using satellite imaging and seismographs. 
      News outlets regularly report on studies warning about "The Big One," a potential magnitude 7.8+ earthquake expected in Southern California. 
      Research shows that while smaller quakes release some pressure, the fault still holds enough strain to cause major damage when it eventually slips again.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="content">
      The San Andreas Fault is both a natural wonder and a major geological threat. 
      The 1906 earthquake reshaped not only San Francisco but also our understanding of how Earth's crust behaves. 
      Through science, engineering, and preparation, humanity has learned to coexist with the forces beneath our feet — 
      always watching, waiting, and ready for the next great movement of the San Andreas Fault. Or Earthquakes in other regions.
